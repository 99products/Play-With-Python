# **Getting Started**

Where and how do we start, and setup your PC to practice the problems

## **Courses**

There are 3 options to learn python,

*   Tutorialspoint and w3 schools are easier and better option to get started, it’s simple and easier to understand, not much of detail, this is recommended to get started quick,  
    [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm)  
    [https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - You can learn and practice in browser itself
*   From Google, from experts, it’s a bit lengthy, they are few lecture videos here which talks about python in detail,

*   If we are more of a mobile user, this is recommended if you are more of a mobile user than laptop and I learnt python using this only. [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn.python](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn.python)

## Python setup

Install python from here based on your OS

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

Once installed make sure you have everything setup properly,

*   Ensure you have python available from command line
    *   [https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-python-from-the-command-line](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-python-from-the-command-line)
*   Ensure you have pip available
    *   All programming languages have predefined libraries and modules, pip is the tool used by python to install the dependent modules, for example if we want to read and write excel file using python, we will use a module called openpyxl, to use this module, we install it via pip

## IDE setup

Integrated Development Environment, its a code editor where it will be very easy to code with many assist features, and easy to run. For python, the best IDE so far is ‘PyCharm’ IDE

[https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) Download the community edition

If you have less configuration laptop, try visual studio code or sublime text editor.
